## Flask-Generate

There are many methods and conventions for structuring Python web applications.
Although certain frameworks are shipped with tools (for scaffolding) to automate -- and ease -- the task (and the headaches),
almost all solutions rely on packaging / modularizing applications as the codebase gets distributed [logically] across related files and folders

So I copied this [article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-structure-large-flask-applications) and built Flask-Generate.

There are no tests :( I will add those later...well maybe. Also the code has no error handling and is placed basically in a single file.
